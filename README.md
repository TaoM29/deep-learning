# Deep Learning Projects Repository

## Overview
**This repository contains a collection of deep learning templates organized into three main categories:**
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**
- **Dense Neural Networks**
- **Segmentation Models**
- **Data Augmentation**

Each category includes Jupyter Notebooks and Python scripts designed for easy experimentation and application.

### 2. Dense Neural Network
- **Folder:** [Dense](Dense/)
- **Description:** This project serves as a template for building Dense Neural Networks, focusing on classification tasks. It includes model architecture, training process, and performance evaluation.
- **Files Included:**
  - `dense_template.ipynb`: Interactive Jupyter Notebook for understanding and experimenting with the Dense network.
  - `dense_template.py`: Python script for executing the Dense neural network model.

### 3. Segmentation Model
- **Folder:** [Segmentation](Segmentation/)
- **Description:** This project implements segmentation models, including data preparation techniques and evaluation metrics for segmentation tasks.
- **Files Included:**
  - `segm_template.ipynb`: Interactive Jupyter Notebook for exploring segmentation techniques.
  - `segm_template.py`: Python script for running the segmentation model.

### 4. Augmentative (Data Augmentation)
- **Folder:** [Augmentative](Augmentative/)
- **Description:** This project provides a template for applying data augmentation techniques to enhance the diversity of training datasets. Augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping, zoom, and brightness adjustment are covered.
- **Files Included:**
