Description

This repository contains a collection of deep learning templates, each designed to demonstrate different neural network architectures and their applications.
The templates are organized into three main categories: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Dense Neural Networks, and Segmentation models.
Each project includes both Jupyter Notebooks and Python scripts for easy experimentation and execution.
